    "Given an array ‘arr’ consisting of integers, the task is to find the number of subsets such that their sum is equal to zero. Empty subset should also be considered.\n",

    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** arr[] = {2, 2, -4}\n",
    "Output : 2\n",
    "All possible subsets:\n",

    "One simple approach is to generate all possible subsets recursively and count number of subsets with sum equals 0. Time complexity of this approach will be O(2^n).\n",
    "\n",
    "A better approach will be using Dynamic programming.\n",
    "Let’s suppose sum of all the elements we have selected upto index ‘i-1’ is ‘S’. So, starting from index ‘i’, we have to find number of subsets of the sub-array{i, N-1} with sum equals -S.\n",
    "Let’s define dp[i][S]. It means number of the subset of the subarray{i, N-1} of ‘arr’ with sum equals ‘-S’.\n",
    "If we are at ith index, we have two choices, i.e. to include it in the sum or leave it.\n",
    "Thus, the required recurrence relation becomes\n",

    "dp[i][s] = dp[i+1][s+arr[i]] + dp[i+1][s]\n",
